    "Bayesian statistics is a branch of statistics that uses Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. Unlike frequentist statistics, which focuses on the frequency of events in the long run, Bayesian statistics incorporates prior beliefs about the hypothesis and updates these beliefs based on observed data. This makes it particularly useful in situations with limited data or where prior knowledge is valuable."
