# **Markdown** ðŸ’¬

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isnâ€™t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

## **Bolding**

this is a **bold text**

## **Italic**

this is an *italicized text*

## **Blockquote**

> blockquote

## **Ordered List**

For ordered lists, use numbers followed by a period for the items like so 1.. Tabs still work for sub ordered lists.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## **Unordered List**

For unordered lists use a hyphen - or asterisk '*' with a space before the text. If you want a sub bullet add a tab before the hyphen - or asterisk '*'.

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

## **Inputting LaTeX**

In the markdown cell, you can add LaTeX code between $ for inline outputs. You can also use two $$ to create its own cantered paragraph in display mode.

$ x = 2 $

- To add a little spacing in display mode, use \
- To add a new line when in math display mode, use \\
- To display a fraction, use \frac{arg 1}{arg 2}
- For power (superscripts text), use ^{}
- For indices (subscripts), use _{}
- For roots, use \sqrt[n]{arg}
- The [n] is optional.
