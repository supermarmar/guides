# **Regex** üî£

Regular expressions, often shortened to regex or regexp, is a language used for pattern-matching text content. It is implemented in several different programming languages, either directly or through libraries. Languages that implement regular expressions include Python, Java, JavaScript, C and C++. Regular expressions are generally standardized, though some implementations may provide some additions and variations to the basic syntax.

Implementation in each programming language is generally through functions and methods that accept some text and a regular expression pattern, and return a result based on what the regular expression pattern matched in the text.

## **Regular Expression Patterns**

A regular expression pattern is a string made up of normal characters mixed with metacharacters that have special meanings defining how characters should be matched. For instance, the pattern ‚Äúh‚Äù by itself would match the single letter ‚Äúh‚Äù, whereas if we add the metacharacter ‚Äú.‚Äù, which matches any one character, then ‚Äúh.‚Äù would match sequences such as ‚Äúha‚Äù, ‚Äúho‚Äù, ‚Äúh5‚Äù and ‚Äúh!‚Äù.

Regular expressions use the following metacharacters and sequences for pattern matching:

## **Literals**

The simplest text we can match with regular expressions are literals. This is where our regular expression contains the exact text that we want to match. The regex a, for example, will match the text a, and the regex bananas will match the text bananas.

We can additionally match just part of a piece of text. Perhaps we are searching a document to see if the word monkey occurs, since we love monkeys. We could use the regex monkey to match monkey in the piece of text The monkeys like to eat bananas..

Not only are we able to match alphabetical characters ‚Äî digits work as well! The regex 3 will match the 3 in the piece of text 34, and the regex 5 gibbons will completely match the text 5 gibbons!

Regular expressions operate by moving character by character, from left to right, through a piece of text. When the regular expression finds a character that matches the first piece of the expression, it looks to find a continuous sequence of matching characters.

## **Alternation**

Alternation, performed in regular expressions with the pipe symbol, `|`, allows us to match either the characters preceding the `|` OR the characters after the `|`. The regex `baboons|gorillas` will match baboons in the text `I love baboons`, but will also match gorillas in the `text I love gorillas`.

## **Character Sets**

Character sets, denoted by a pair of brackets `[]`, let us match one character from a series of characters, allowing for matches with incorrect or different spellings.

The regex `con[sc]en[sc]us` will match consensus, the correct spelling of the word, but also match the following three incorrect spellings: concensus, consencus, and concencus. The letters inside the first brackets, s and c, are the different possibilities for the character that comes after con and before en. Similarly for the second brackets, s and c are the different character possibilities to come after en and before us.

Thus the regex `[cat]` will match the characters c, a, or t, but not the text cat.

The beauty of character sets (and alternation) is that they allow our regular expressions to become more flexible and less rigid than by just matching with literals!

## **Negation**

We can make our character sets even more powerful with the help of the caret `^` symbol. Placed at the front of a character set, the `^` negates the set, matching any character that is not stated. These are called negated character sets. Thus the regex `[^cat]` will match any character that is not c, a, or t, and would completely match each character d, o or g.

## **Wildcards**

Sometimes we don‚Äôt care exactly WHAT characters are in a text, just that there are SOME characters. Enter the wildcard `.`. Wildcards will match any single character (letter, number, symbol or whitespace) in a piece of text. They are useful when we do not care about the specific value of a character, but only that a character exists!

Let‚Äôs say we want to match any 9-character piece of text. The regex `.........` will completely match `orangutan` and `marsupial`! Similarly, the regex `I ate . bananas` will completely match both `I ate 3 bananas` and `I ate 8 bananas`!

What happens if we want to match an actual period, `.`? We can use the escape character, `\`, to escape the wildcard functionality of the `.` and match an actual period. The regex `Howler monkeys are really lazy\.` will completely match the text `Howler monkeys are really lazy.`.

## **Ranges**

Character sets are great, but their true power isn‚Äôt realized without ranges. Ranges allow us to specify a range of characters in which we can make a match without having to type out each individual character. The regex `[abc]`, which would match any character a, b, or c, is equivalent to regex range `[a-c]`. The `-` character allows us to specify that we are interested in matching a range of characters.

The regex `I adopted [2-9] [b-h]ats` will match the text `I adopted 4 bats` as well as `I adopted 8 cats` and even `I adopted 5 hats`.

With ranges we can match any single capital letter with the regex `[A-Z]`, lowercase letter with the regex `[a-z]`, any digit with the regex `[0-9]`. We can even have multiple ranges in the same character set! To match any single capital or lowercase alphabetical character, we can use the regex `[A-Za-z]`.

Remember, within any character set `[]` we only match one character.

## **Shorthand Character Classes**

While character ranges are extremely useful, they can be cumbersome to write out every single time you want to match common ranges such as those that designate alphabetical characters or digits. To alleviate this pain, there are shorthand character classes that represent common ranges, and they make writing much simpler. These shorthand classes include:

- `\w`: the ‚Äúword character‚Äù class represents the regex range `[A-Za-z0-9_]`, and it matches a single uppercase character, lowercase character, digit or underscore
- `\d`: the ‚Äúdigit character‚Äù class represents the regex range `[0-9]`, and it matches a single digit character
- `\s`: the ‚Äúwhitespace character‚Äù class represents the regex range `[ \t\r\n\f\v]`, matching a single space, tab, carriage return, line break, form feed, or vertical tab
For example, the regex `\d\s\w\w\w\w\w\w\w` matches a digit character, followed by a whitespace character, followed by 7 word characters. Thus the regex completely matches the text `3 monkeys`.

In addition to the shorthand character classes `\w`, `\d`, and `\s`, we also have access to the negated shorthand character classes! These shorthands will match any character that is NOT in the regular shorthand classes. These negated shorthand classes include:

- `\W`: the ‚Äúnon-word character‚Äù class represents the regex range `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by `\w`
- `\D`: the ‚Äúnon-digit character‚Äù class represents the regex range `[^0-9]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by `\d`
- `\S`: the ‚Äúnon-whitespace character‚Äù class represents the regex range `[^ \t\r\n\f\v]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by `\s`

## **Grouping**

But what if we want to match the whole piece of text `I love baboons` and `I love gorillas` with the same regex? Your first guess might be to use the regex `I love baboons|gorillas`. This regex, while it would completely match the string `I love baboons`, would not match `I love gorillas`, and would instead match `gorillas`. This is because the | symbol matches the entire expression before or after itself.

Grouping to the rescue! Grouping, denoted with the open parenthesis `(` and the closing parenthesis `)`, lets us group parts of a regular expression together, and allows us to limit alternation to part of the regex.

The regex `I love (baboons|gorillas)` will match the text `I love` and then match either `baboons` or `gorillas`, as the grouping limits the reach of the `|` to the text within the parentheses.

These groups are also called capture groups, as they have the power to select, or capture, a substring from our matched text.

## **Quantifiers**

### **Fixed**

Here‚Äôs where things start to get really interesting. So far we have only matched text on a character by character basis. But instead of writing the regex `\w\w\w\w\w\w\s\w\w\w\w\w\w`, which would match 6 word characters, followed by a whitespace character, and then followed by more 6 word characters, such as in the text `rhesus monkey`, is there a better way to denote the quantity of characters we want to match?

The answer is yes, with the help of quantifiers! Fixed quantifiers, denoted with curly braces `{}`, let us indicate the exact quantity of a character we wish to match, or allow us to provide a quantity range to match on.

- `\w{3}` will match exactly 3 word characters
- `\w{4,7}` will match at minimum 4 word characters and at maximum 7 word characters

The regex `roa{3}r` will match the characters `ro` followed by 3 `a`'s, and then the character `r`, such as in the text `roaaar`. The regex `roa{3,7}r` will match the characters `ro` followed by at least 3 `a`'s and at most 7 `a`'s, followed by an `r`, matching the strings `roaaar`, `roaaaaar` and `roaaaaaaar`.

An important note is that quantifiers are considered to be greedy. This means that they will match the greatest quantity of characters they possibly can. For example, the regex `mo{2,4}` will match the text `moooo` in the string  `moooo`, and not return a match of `moo`, or `mooo`. This is because the fixed quantifier wants to match the largest number of `o`'s as possible, which is 4 in the string `moooo`.

### **Optional**

Optional quantifiers, indicated by the question mark `?`, allow us to indicate a character in a regex is optional, or can appear either 0 times or 1 time. For example, the regex `humou?r` matches the characters `humo`, then either 0 occurrences or 1 occurrence of the letter `u`, and finally the letter `r`. Note the `?` only applies to the character directly before it.

With all quantifiers, we can take advantage of grouping to make even more advanced regexes. The regex `The monkey ate a (rotten )?banana` will completely match both `The monkey ate a rotten banana` and `The monkey ate a banana`.

Since the `?` is a metacharacter, you need to use the escape character in your regex in order to match a question mark `?` in a piece of text. The regex `Aren't owl monkeys beautiful\?` will thus completely match the text `Aren't owl monkeys beautiful?`.

### **0 or More, 1 or More**

In 1951, mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene developed a system to match patterns in written language with mathematical notation. This notation is now known as regular expressions!

In his honor, the next piece of regular expressions syntax we will learn is known as the Kleene star. The Kleene star, denoted with the asterisk `*`, is also a quantifier, and matches the preceding character 0 or more times. This means that the character doesn‚Äôt need to appear, can appear once, or can appear many many times.

The regex `meo*w` will match the characters `me`, followed by 0 or more `o`s, followed by a `w`. Thus the regex will match `mew`, `meow`, `meooow`, and `meoooooooooooow`.

Another useful quantifier is the Kleene plus, denoted by the plus `+`, which matches the preceding character 1 or more times.
The regex `meo+w` will match the characters `me`, followed by 1 or more `o`s, followed by a `w`. Thus the regex will match `meow`, `meooow`, and `meoooooooooooow`, but not match `mew`.

## **Anchors**

When writing regular expressions, it‚Äôs useful to make the expression as specific as possible in order to ensure that we do not match unintended text. To aid in this mission of specificity, we can use the anchor metacharacters. The anchors hat `^` and dollar sign `$` are used to match text at the start and the end of a string, respectively.

The regex `^Monkeys: my mortal enemy$` will completely match the text `Monkeys: my mortal enemy` but not match `Spider Monkeys: my mortal enemy in the wild` or `Squirrel Monkeys: my mortal enemy in the wild`. The `^` ensures that the matched text begins with Monkeys, and the `$` ensures the matched text ends with enemy.
