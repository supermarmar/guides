# **Power Bi** üñ•Ô∏è

The building blocks of Power BI are **semantic models** and **visuals**. Using Power BI Desktop, you create the semantic model and use visuals to create **reports**. In the Power BI service, you can distribute content to your consumers and use reports to create **dashboards**.

- **Sematic Models**: A semantic model consists of all connected data, transformations, relationships, and calculations. To follow the flow of Power BI, you first connect to data, transform data, and create relationships and calculations to create a semantic model.
- **Reports**: In Power BI Desktop, when you create a visualization (also called visual), you add it to the canvas for a report page. Choose your visualizations to build pages in your report. It's ideal to keep each page simple with related data, so consumers can easily see the insights.
- **Dashboards**: Dashboards consist of a single page made up of tiles. Add tiles to a dashboard by pinning a visual in a report to the dashboard. Tiles aren't interactive like visuals, so when a user interacts with the tile, they go to the underlying report for more information.
- **Workspaces**: Workspaces are the foundation of the Power BI service. When publishing any report, you must choose a workspace. By default, every user has access to My workspace, which is ideal only for testing. When you want to share content with others, always create and use a shared workspace.
- **Apps**: In a workspace, you can create an app, which provides consumers a simplified interface to access reports and dashboards. In the app configuration, you set up the app, select the content to include (limited to the current workspace), and choose your audience.
