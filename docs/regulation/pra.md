When opening a bank or building society account, you are putting your trust in that firm. You trust that it will look after your money and that it will be there when you want access to it. Also, if you buy a policy with an insurer, you would expect it to pay out when you need it.

Banks, as well as other financial services (eg insurers and building societies) are all businesses. Their success is measured in the same way as others, including by the profit they make. But they also hold your money so that you can make payments and manage your finances – and there is a responsibility that comes with this.

That is where the PRA comes in. As part of the Bank of England, it makes sure firms do business safely and reduce their chances of getting into financial difficulty.

The PRA was established as part of a new wave of regulation after the financial crisis of 2008. Today, it supervises about 1,500 financial institutions.

## SS4/24 – Credit risk internal ratings based approach

First published on 12 September 2024

<https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/supervisory-statement/2024/credit-risk-internal-ratings-based-approach-supervisory-statement.pdf>

This supervisory statement (SS) sets out the Prudential Regulation Authority’s (PRA’s) expectations in respect of the application of the IRB approach in the calculation of credit risk risk-weighted assets and provides explanation, where appropriate, of the PRA’s expectations when assessing whether firms meet those requirements, including in respect of the conservatism applied. 

This SS is relevant to PRA-authorised banks, building societies, PRA-designated investment firms, and PRA-approved or PRA-designated financial or mixed financial holding companies (collectively ‘firms’).

The SS has 21 chapters:

- Chapter 1: introduction and definitions
- Chapter 2: permission to use the IRB approach
- Chapter 3: partial use and reversion to less sophisticated approaches
- Chapter 4: use and experience test
- Chapter 5: qualifying revolving retail exposures
- Chapter 6: high level expectations
- Chapter 7: rating systems
- Chapter 8: data representativeness
- Chapter 9: model deficiencies and margin of conservatism
- Chapter 10: PD – model developments
- Chapter 11: PD – calibration
- Chapter 12: LGD – general expectations and model development
- Chapter 13: LGD – calibration (general)
- Chapter 14: LGD – calibration (long-run average)
- Chapter 15: LGD – calibration (downturn)
- Chapter 16: LGD – in-default estimation
- Chapter 17: EAD – model development and calibration
- Chapter 18: the slotting approach
- Chapter 19: application of risk parameters
- Chapter 20: stress tests used in the assessment capital adequacy
- Chapter 21: review of estimates (validation)

### Chapter 9: MoC

9.1 Firms should identify all deficiencies related to the estimation of risk parameters that lead to a bias in the quantification of those parameters, or to increased uncertainty that is not fully captured by the general estimation error, and classify each deficiency into one of the following groups:

- (a) Group A: identified data and methodological deficiencies; and
- (b) Group B: relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies, and any other source of additional uncertainty.

9.2 For the purposes of identifying and classifying all deficiencies referred to in paragraph 9.1, firms should take into account all relevant deficiencies in methods, processes, controls, data, or IT systems that have been identified by the credit risk control unit, validation function, internal audit function, or any other internal or external review, and should analyse at least all of the following potential sources of additional uncertainty in risk quantification:

- (a) under Group A:
  - (i) missing or materially changed default triggers in historical observations, including changed criteria for recognition of materially past due credit obligations;
  - (ii) missing or inaccurate date of default;
  - (iii) missing, inaccurate, or outdated rating assignment used for assessing historical grades or pools for the purpose of calculation of default rates or average realised LGDs per grade or pool;
  - (iv) missing or inaccurate information on the source of cash flows;
  - (v) missing, inaccurate or outdated data on risk drivers and rating criteria;
  - (vi) missing or inaccurate information used for the estimation of future recoveries as referred to in paragraph 14.13;
  - (vii) missing or inaccurate data for the calculation of economic loss;
  - (viii) limited representativeness of the historical observations due to the use of external data;
  - (ix) potential bias stemming from the choice of the approach to calculating the average of observed one-year default rates in accordance with paragraph 11.10;
  - (x) necessity of adjusting the average of observed one-year default rates in accordance with paragraph 11.18; and
  - (xi) missing information for the purpose of estimating loss rates or for the purpose of reflecting economic downturn in LGD estimates;
- (b) under Group B:
  - (i) changes to underwriting standards, collection or recovery policies, risk appetite, or other relevant internal processes;
  - (ii) unjustified deviations in the ranges of values of the key risk characteristics of the application portfolio compared with those of the data set used for risk quantification;
  - (iii) changes to the market or legal environment; and
  - (iv) forward-looking expectations regarding potential changes in the structure of the portfolio or the level of risk, especially based on actions or decisions that have already been taken but which are not reflected in the observed data.

9.3 In order to overcome biases in risk parameter estimates stemming from the identified deficiencies referred to in paragraphs 9.1 and 9.2, firms should apply adequate methodologies to correct the identified deficiencies to the extent possible. The PRA expects that the impact of these methodologies on the risk parameter (‘appropriate adjustment’) should result in a more accurate estimate of the risk parameter (‘modelled estimate’) and that the appropriate adjustment may either result in an increase or a decrease in the value of the risk parameter. A firm should ensure and provide evidence that the application

9.5 The PRA expects that firms should regularly monitor the adequacy of appropriate adjustments. The PRA considers that the adoption of an appropriate adjustment by a firm does not replace the need to address identified model deficiencies.

9.6 As required Articles 179(1)(f) and 180(1)(e) of the Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part, firms should add an MoC to parameter estimates that is related to the expected range of estimation errors. The PRA expects that firms should implement a framework for the quantification, documentation, and monitoring of these estimation errors.

9.7 The final MoC added to a risk parameter estimate should reflect the uncertainty of estimation in respect of all of the following:

- Category A: the MoC related to data and methodological deficiencies identified under Group A as referred to in paragraph 9.1(a);
- Category B: the MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies, and any other source of additional uncertainty identified under Group B as referred to in paragraph 9.1(b); and
- Category C: the general estimation error.

9.8 In order to quantify the applicable MoC, firms should do all of the following:

- (a) quantify the Category A and Category B MoC for the identified deficiencies referred to in paragraphs 9.1 and 9.2, to the extent not covered by the general estimation error.
- (b) quantify the general estimation error for the Category C MoC referred to in paragraph 9.7 associated with the underlying estimation method at least for every calibration segment; the MoC for the general estimation error should reflect the dispersion of the distribution of the statistical estimator

9.9 For the purpose of paragraph 9.8(a), and for each of the Categories A and B, firms may group all or selected deficiencies, where justified, for the purpose of quantifying the MoC.

9.10 Firms should quantify the final MoC as the sum of:

- (a) the Category A MoC as referred to in paragraph 9.7;
- (b) the Category B MoC as referred to in paragraph 9.7; and
- (c) the Category C MoC for the general estimation error as referred to in paragraph 9.7.

9.11 Firms should add the final MoC to the modelled estimate of the risk parameter.

9.12 Firms should ensure that the impact of the final MoC does not result in a reduction of parameter estimates.

9.13 Firms should consider the overall impact of the identified deficiencies and the resulting final MoC on the soundness of the model and ensure that estimates of risk parameters and resulting capital requirements are not distorted by the need for excessive adjustments.

9.15 The PRA expects firms to regularly monitor the levels of MoCs. The PRA considers that the adoption of a MoC by a firm does not replace the need to address the causes of errors or uncertainties, or to correct the models to ensure material compliance with the requirements of the Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part.

### Chapter 17: EAD

17.1 Firms may choose to provide own estimates of EAD in place of the own estimates of CF
in accordance with Article 166D(3) of the Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach
(CRR) Part. Firms are also required to estimate EAD for certain exposures according to
Article 166D(4) of the Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part.

17.2 The PRA considers that there are a number of potentially compliant approaches to
estimate EAD and that an acceptable approach is to estimate EAD as a percentage of total
limit (Limit Factor estimation).

17.3 The PRA considers that firms estimating Limit Factors may either:

- (a) use Limit Factor estimates as an intermediate step to obtain formulaically derived
long-run average and downturn CF estimates in accordance with Articles 182(1)(a)
and 182(1)(b) of the Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part; or
- (b) use long-run average and downturn Limit Factors to obtain estimates of EAD in
accordance with Article 182(1)(a) and Article 182(1)(b) of the Credit Risk: Internal
Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part.

17.6 Downturn EAD or CF estimates should reflect the exposure expected to be outstanding
under a current facility should it go into default in the next year, assuming that:

- (a) economic downturn conditions occur in the next year; and
- (b) the firm’s policies and practices for controlling exposures remain unchanged, other
than changes that result from the economic downturn conditions.

17.8 The PRA expects firms using own estimates of EAD or CF to do all of the following in
respect of EAD or CF estimates:
- (a) apply EAD or CF estimates at the level of the individual facility;
- (b) where there is a paucity of observations, ensure that long-run average and downturn
EAD or CF estimates are cautious, conservative and justifiable. In accordance with
Article 179(1)(a) of the Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part,
estimates must be derived using both historical experience and empirical evidence,
and must not be based purely on judgemental consideration. The PRA expects firms
to document their justification of why they consider their estimates to be sufficiently
conservative;
- (c) identify and explain at a granular level how each estimate has been derived. This
should include an explanation of how internal data, any external data, expert
judgement, or a combination of these has been used to produce the estimate;
- (d) clearly document the process for determining and reviewing estimates, and the parties
involved in the process in cases where expert judgement was used;
- (e) demonstrate an understanding of the impact of the economic cycle on exposure
values and be able to use that understanding in deriving downturn EAD or CF
estimates;
- (f) demonstrate sufficient understanding of any external benchmarks used and identify
the extent of their relevance and suitability to the extent that the firm can satisfy itself
that they are fit for purpose;
- (g) evidence that they are aware of any weaknesses in their estimation process and set
standards, for example related to accuracy, that their estimates are designed to meet;
- (h) ensure that in most cases estimates incorporate effective discrimination on the basis
of at least product features and customer type. In cases where these risk drivers are
not incorporated into EAD or CF estimates, then the PRA expects the firm to be able
to demonstrate why they are not relevant;
- (i) have an ongoing data collection framework to collect all relevant internal exposure
data required for estimating EADs or CFs and a framework to start using this data as
soon as any meaningful information becomes available;
- (j) make use of data that have been collected to identify all relevant drivers of EAD or CF
and understand how these drivers would be affected by a downturn; and
- (k) identify dependencies between default rates and EADs or CFs for various products
and markets when estimating downturn EADs. Firms are expected to consider how they expect their own policies regarding exposure management to evolve in a
downturn.

17.9 Where risk drivers are sensitive to the economic cycle, firms should undertake the
analysis set out in Article 182(1)(b)(ii)(1) of the Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach
(CRR) Part and make any adjustments to the downturn EADs or CFs that are required by
Article 181(1)(b)(ii)(2) of the Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part.

17.10 The PRA expects that firms directly estimating CFs, in accordance with Article
182(1)(a) of the Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part, should ensure that
their CF estimates are appropriate for the exposures upon which they are based and that the
potential for modelled CF estimates to be biased by facilities that are close to being fully
drawn at the observation date are minimised.

17.11 In order to ensure that CF estimates are not biased due to facilities being close to fully
drawn at observation date in accordance with paragraph 17.8, the PRA expects that where
RDSs contain a significant number of such observations, firms should:

- (a) investigate the distribution of realised CFs in the RDS;
- (b) base the estimated CF on an appropriate point along that distribution that results in the
choice of a CF appropriate for the exposures to which it is being applied and a CF
consistent with the requirement in Article 179(1)(f) of the Credit Risk: Internal Ratings
Based Approach (CRR) Part for estimates to include a MoC related to estimation
errors;
- (c) be cognisant that while the median of the distribution might be a starting point, they
should not assume without analysis that the median represents a reasonable unbiased
estimate. The PRA expects firms to consider whether the pattern of distribution in
realised CFs means that some further segmentation is needed (eg treating facilities
that are close to full utilisation differently); and
- (d) apply the more conservative of the long-run average CF or the downturn CF estimate,
including where percentile approaches to estimation are used.

17.12 The cases where an EAD or CF shall be modelled are set out in Article 166D of the
Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part.

17.13 The PRA has not set an expectation that firms should include the probability of
increases in limits between observation and default date in their EAD or CF estimates. If the
impact of such increases is reflected in the RDS, firms may adjust EAD or CF estimates to
reflect what the exposure would have been at default if the limit had not been increased. The
PRA expects that firms should only make such adjustments if they can be made in a robust
manner.

17.14 The PRA expects that accrued interest as referred to in paragraph 17.15, other due
payments, and limit excesses should be included in EAD or CF reference data.

17.15 The PRA expects that estimation of accrued interest should take account of changes in
the contractual interest rate over the time horizon up to default, in a way that is consistent
with the scenario envisaged in the estimation of the long-run average, or downturn EADs or
CFs.

17.16 The PRA considers that inclusion of post-default interest does not need to be included
in estimates of either EAD or CF, or LGD.

17.17 The PRA expects that measures of realised EADs or CFs in reference data should not
be capped to the principal amount outstanding or facility limits.

17.18 The PRA expects that firms directly estimating CFs should exclude exposures at, or in
excess of, limit at observation from the RDS used to model under-limit accounts.

17.19 The PRA expects that EAD or CF estimates for accounts in excess of their limit should
reflect the risk of further drawings.

17.20 Firms may estimate EADs or CFs for exposures with undrawn limits on the basis of net
limits provided the conditions in Article 205 of the Credit Risk Mitigation (CRR) Part are met.
The PRA considers however that as EAD or CF estimates should reflect the amount that
would be outstanding in the event of a default a firm’s estimates should reflect that the firm’s
ability to constrain the drawdown of credit balances in such a scenario will be particularly tested. Moreover, the PRA expects the appropriate CF estimate to be higher when measured
as a percentage of a net limit than of a gross limit.

17.21 The PRA considers that the lower the net limit as a percentage of gross limits or
exposures, the greater the need on the part of the firm to ensure that it is restricting
exposures below net limits in practice and that it will be able to continue to do so should
borrowers encounter difficulties. The PRA considers that application of a zero net limit is
acceptable in principle, but that there is consequently a very high need for a firm applying a
zero net limit to ensure that breaches of it are not tolerated.

17.22 Estimation of EADs or CFs for facilities that are underwritten in the course of primary
market syndication may take account of anticipated sell down to other parties.

17.23 The PRA expects that as EADs or CFs need to be estimated conditional on default by
a borrower taking place in a one-year horizon subject to downturn conditions, any reduction
in EADs or CFs in anticipation of syndication should take account of this scenario
