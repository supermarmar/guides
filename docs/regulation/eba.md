# **European Banking Authority**

## **Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR)**

In response to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, the Union embarked on a wide-ranging reform of the prudential framework for institutions, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) with a view to increasing the resilience of the Union banking sector. One of the main elements of the reform consisted of the implementation of the international standards agreed in 2010 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), specifically the so-called ‘Basel III reform’ and the resulting Basel III standards. Thanks to that reform, the Union banking sector entered the COVID-19 crisis on a resilient footing. However, while the overall level of capital in institutions in the Union is now generally satisfactory, some of the problems that were identified in the wake of the global financial crisis have yet to be addressed.

### Article 179: Overall requirements for estimation

1. In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements:

- (a) an institution's own estimates of the risk parameters PD, LGD, conversion factor and EL shall incorporate all relevant data, information and methods. The estimates shall be derived using both historical experience and empirical evidence, and not based purely on judgemental considerations. The estimates shall be plausible and intuitive and shall be based on the material drivers of the respective risk parameters. The less data an institution has, the more conservative it shall be in its estimation;
- (b) an institution shall be able to provide a breakdown of its loss experience in terms of default frequency, LGD, conversion factor, or loss where EL estimates are used, by the factors it sees as the drivers of the respective risk parameters. The institution's estimates shall be representative of long run experience;
- (f) an institution shall add to its estimates a margin of conservatism that is related to the expected range of estimation errors. Where methods and data are considered to be less satisfactory, the expected range of errors is larger, the margin of conservatism shall be larger.

### Article 182: Requirements specific to own-conversion factor estimates

1. In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements specific to own-conversion factor estimates:

   - (a) institutions shall estimate conversion factors by facility grade or pool on the basis of the average realised conversion factors by facility grade or pool using the default weighted average resulting from all observed defaults within the data sources;
   - (b) institutions shall use conversion factor estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average. To the extent a rating system is expected to deliver realised conversion factors at a constant level by grade or pool over time, institutions shall make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn;
   - (c) institutions' estimates of conversion factors shall reflect the possibility of additional drawings by the obligor up to and after the time a default event is triggered. The conversion factor estimate shall incorporate a larger margin of conservatism where a stronger positive correlation can reasonably be expected between the default frequency and the magnitude of conversion factor;
   - (f) if institutions use different estimates of conversion factors for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and internal purposes it shall be documented and be reasonable.

2. For exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks, estimates of conversion factors shall be based on data over a minimum of five years, increasing by one year each year after implementation until a minimum of seven years is reached, for at least one data source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and the data is relevant, this longer period shall be used.
3. For retail exposures, institutions may reflect future drawings either in their conversion factors or in their LGD estimates.
For retail exposures, estimates of conversion factors shall be based on data over a minimum of five years. By way of derogation from point (a) of paragraph 1, an institution need not give equal importance to historic data if more recent data is a better predictor of draw downs. Subject to the permission of competent authorities, institutions may use, when they implement the IRB Approach, relevant data covering a period of two years. The period to be covered shall increase by one year each year until relevant data cover a period of five years.
4. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following:
   - (a) the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn referred to in paragraph 1;
   - (b) conditions according to which a competent authority may permit and institution to use relevant data covering a period of two years at the time an institution first implements the IRB Approach.

EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.

By 31 December 2026, EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, to specify the methodology that institutions are to apply in order to estimate IRB-CCF.

## Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS)

<https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/10180/1525916/e8373cbc-cc4b-4dd9-83b5-93c9657a39f0/Final%20Draft%20RTS%20on%20Assessment%20Methodology%20for%20IRB.pdf>

The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) set out
prudential requirements for banks and other financial institutions which have been applied from
1 January 2014. Among others, the CRR contains specific mandates for the EBA to develop draft
regulatory technical standards (RTS) to specify the assessment methodology competent
authorities shall follow in assessing the compliance of an institution with the requirements to use
the Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRB Approach).

These final draft RTS are considered an integral part of the efforts of the EBA to ensure
consistency in model outputs and comparability of risk weighted exposure amounts. It is
expected that these final draft RTS will enable harmonisation of the supervisory assessment
methodology across all EU Member States. They will therefore rectify the issues identified in this
regard in the EBA report on the comparability of IRB models and provide enhanced clarity on
various aspects of the application of the IRB Approach.

These final draft RTS set out standards for competent authorities in assessing an institution’s
compliance with minimum IRB requirements as defined in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 of the
CRR, when the institution initially applies to use the IRB Approach, applies to use the IRB
Approach for certain types of exposures in accordance with the sequential implementation plan,
applies for implementation of material changes to the IRB Approach or applies to return to the use
of less sophisticated approaches.

### Chapter 8: Assessment methodology for risk quantification

#### Section 2: Overall Risk Parameter Quantification

##### Article 47: MoC

1. Competent authorities shall assess whether an appropriate margin of conservatism is
included in the values of risk parameters used in the calculation of capital requirements
as referred to in point (f) of Article 179(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, in the
following situations:

   - (a) the methods and data do not provide sufficient certainty of the risk parameter
estimates, including where there are high estimation errors;
   - (b) relevant deficiencies in the methods, information and data have been identified
by the credit risk control unit, validation function or internal audit function or
any other function of the institution;
   - (c) relevant changes to the standards of underwriting or recovery policies or changes
in the institution’s risk appetite.
2. The requirements laid down in paragraph 1 shall not prevent an application of the
requirements laid down in Article 146 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and any related
corrective actions by the institution, but shall apply in addition to them.

#### Section 5: EAD

##### Article 56: Length of the historical observation period

In assessing the length of the historical observation period used for conversion factors
estimation, as referred to in Article 182(2), (3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,
competent authorities shall verify that:

- (a) the length of the historical observation period covers at least the minimum
length in accordance with the requirements laid down in Article 182(2) and (3)
of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and, where applicable, the Commission
Delegated Regulation adopting technical standards laid down in Article
182(4)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
- (b) where the available observation period is longer than the minimum period laid
down in Article 182(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for a source, and the data obtained from it are relevant, that the information for that
longer period is used;
- (c) for retail exposures, where the institution does not give equal importance to all
historical data used, that this is justified by better prediction of conversion
factors and that specific weights applied to realised conversion factors are
significantly higher than zero.

##### Article 57: Method of conversion factors estimation

In assessing the method of conversion factors estimation, as referred to in Article 182 of the
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, competent authorities shall verify that:

- (a) the institution assesses estimates of conversion factors by facility grade or pool;
- (b) the average realised conversion factors by facility grade or pool are calculated
using a number of default weighted average;
- (c) all observed defaults within the data sources are used for conversion factors
estimation;
- (d) the possibility of additional drawings are taken into account in a conservative
manner, unless for retail exposures they are included in the LGD estimates;
- (e) the institution’s policies and strategies regarding account monitoring, including
limit monitoring, and payment processing are reflected in the conversion factors
estimation;
- (f) all of the following are adequate to the type of exposures to which they are
applied:
  - (i) the functional and structural form of the estimation method;
  - (ii) assumptions regarding the estimation method;
  - (iii) where applicable the method of estimation of the downturn effect;
  - (iv) length of data series used in accordance with Article 56;
  - (v) margin of conservatism in accordance with Article 47;
  - (vi) the human judgement;
  - (vii) where applicable, the choice of risk drivers.

##### Article 58: Use of conversion factor estimates appropriate for economic downturn

In assessing the requirements for conversion factor estimates as referred to in Article 182 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, competent authorities shall verify that:

- (a) the institution uses conversion factor estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn, where those are more conservative than the long-run
average;
- (b) the institution provides both the long-run averages and the estimates appropriate for an economic downturn as justification for its choices;
- (c) the institution applies a rigorous and well documented process for assessing any effects of economic downturn conditions on drawing of credit limits and for producing conversion factor estimates consistent with downturn conditions, and more in particular that the institution:
  - (i) specifies the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn in
accordance with the technical standards referred to in Article 182(4)(a) of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
  - (ii) incorporates in the conversion factor estimates any adverse dependencies
that have been identified between selected credit and economic factors
versus drawing of credit limits.
